# Stonks
A Discord bot to manage your stocks in Codeforces! On registering your Codeforces handle with the bot, the bot gives you 100 of your stocks and $20 of cash. You can sell your stocks, or buy other stocks from the market. The price of the stocks depend on your rating, and is given by the formula `(1.2)^rank * rating/100` where rank is the number of ranks above Newbie.

## Instructions

- Create a Discord bot and get it's token. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)!

```
export STONKS_TOKEN="<YOUR TOKEN>"
```

- Install the latest version of discord.py using `pip install -U discord.py`.
